# ForageRoblox
Search the game servers that players are in (even with their 'who to join' disabled) and join them!

### How This Works
Roblox shows you 5 players' avatars when you go to a game's servers. Although the servers do not show every player, if you keep refreshing, it will show you new players that this program will collect and store. This program then checks the image of each player and determines if it looks the same as your targets' profiles. This process can be sped up drastically with multiple Roblox accounts and proxies.
